            <h2>Main</h2>
            <p>Hi, I moved to Tampere in 2013 to study in Tampere University of Technology. I graduated as a Master in Automation Engineering in 2017. As i wished to study Finnish , I joined Tredu's language course for Immigrants. I finished the first part of the course in 6 months and then joined Catering school as I had experience working in an Indian kitchen for two years during my university studies and I had a passion for cooking . I graduated from vocational school in 2020 during which I worked as a gig worker for Barona, where I had the opportunity to work in different restaurants in Tampere region . After I graduated from Tredu as a Chef, I joined Spartao Oy where I had the opportunity to learn to Sushi chef and Wok chef . After realising that I wish to have a more challenging work place and wishing to use my Engineering degree, I left my job and currently looking for new opportunities in the field of engineering and web development. I have been polishing my skills when it comes programming languages like Javascript,Html and CSS. </p>
